# L46 Project - Model Development and Compression for Irish Sign Language Translation

## Repository Structure
The repository contains the code and corresponding documentation for my project for L46, which investugates building and compressing machine learning models for irish sign language translation.

The source code files are Static_Gesture_Recognition.ipynb and Dynamic_Gesture_Recognition.ipynb. They are provided in this format so that the results can be shown in the console output and the code can be very easily run. Each file contains the different stages of the processing pipeline for the respective model, which are indicated by the headings separating the blocks of code.

The static gesture file also includes the code for the real-time gesture recognition system, while the dynamic gesture file also includes code which can process clips recorded by the webcam.

The final project report is included in the repository, along with an accompanying document detailing the planning, phases of development and decisions made throughout this project.

The model files are also provided in the repository along with the csv file of landmark data for the dynamic model and 3 sample video clips recorded and used for testing.
